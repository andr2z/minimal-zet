# minimal-zet

Create notes with minimal effort and maximal searchability.
This is a minimal version of [cmd-zet](https://github.com/rwxrob/cmd-zet).

# Changes summary

Contains the minimum of "core" functionalities of `cmd-zet`. The following things changed:
- All video casting features for youtube are removed (This removes the dependency on `yt`)
- `zet`-directories are matched exactly and not partly when switching the current `zet`-directory (e.g. "zet.work" and "zet.work1" are different)
- category-features are removed. You do not need fancy categories, if you have an awesome search
- URL-features are removed
